### Aim of the Project:
1. Exploring and preprocessing our dataset.
2. Visualizing the relationships between features.
3. Training and evaluating a machine learning model for sleep quality prediction.
4. Predicting sleep quality based on user inputs.

# The Analysis
Each step in this project is designed to thoroughly investigate the dataset and develop a reliable sleep quality prediction model. Here's our approach to addressing each objective:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
* **Importing and Reading Dataset:** Initial loading and inspection of the dataset.
* **Null Value Check:** Confirming the absence of null values.
* **Categorical Transformation:** Converting categorical features into numerical values for model compatibility.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **Feature Analysis:** Analyzing the distribution and impact of various features on sleep quality.

* **Note:** This box plot shows that males (coded as 0) generally report higher sleep quality compared to females (coded as 1).

![Sleep Duration by Gender](assets/eda.PNG)
* **Note:** This box plot indicates that males (coded as 0) tend to have a longer sleep duration compared to females (coded as 1).

![Correlation Heatmap](assets/correlation_heatmap.png)
* **Note:** This heatmap illustrates the correlation between various features and sleep quality, highlighting significant relationships.
### ***Key Insights***

**Strong Positive Correlations:**

* **Sleep Duration and Quality of Sleep (0.88):** Indicates that higher sleep duration is strongly associated with better quality of sleep.
* **Physical Activity Level and Daily Steps (0.77):** Shows that higher physical activity levels correspond to more daily steps.

### 3. Machine Learning Model
* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
* **Model Training:** Training a RandomForestClassifier model to predict sleep quality.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Accuracy           | 0.95           | 0.93           |
| Precision          | 0.94           | 0.92           |
| Recall             | 0.95           | 0.93           |
| F1-Score           | 0.94           | 0.92           |

### 4. Prediction
* **User Inputs:** Collecting and validating user inputs for prediction.
  
_e.g._

| Occupation          | Engineer   |
| Sleep Duration      | 7.0        |
| Physical Activity   | 50         |
| Stress Level        | 5          |
| BMI Category        | Normal     |
| Heart Rate          | 70         |
| Daily Steps         | 5000       |
| Sleep Disorder      | None       |
